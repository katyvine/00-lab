##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I determined if the rules were applicable to the whole page (base.css) or if they were layout related or specific to a certain aspect on the page.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not. It was functioning, so I kept it working.
